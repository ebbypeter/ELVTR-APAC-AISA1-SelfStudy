This has started to affect your small blood vessels, which is why you might be experiencing tingling in your feet and changes in your kidney function tests. Your blood pressure is also higher than we want, even with your current medication. Our main focus now is to work together on improving your blood sugar and blood pressure control. We will also support you in making some lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, to help manage your diabetes better. Regular follow-up appointments will be important to keep track of your progress and prevent further complications.\n",
