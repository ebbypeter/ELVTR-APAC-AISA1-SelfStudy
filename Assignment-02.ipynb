Early microvascular complications are emerging, including intermittent peripheral paraesthesia and borderline microalbuminuria, suggesting early diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy. Blood pressure control remains suboptimal on current antihypertensive therapy. Immediate management priorities include intensification of both glycaemic and antihypertensive regimens, reinforcement of lifestyle interventions, and establishment of close interval follow-up to prevent progression of diabetic microvascular disease.\n",

The blood sugar tests we've been monitoring show levels that are higher than our target, which over time can affect different parts of your body. We're seeing some early signs that this is starting to happen—the tingling you've been feeling in your feet and some changes in your kidney function tests suggest your nerves and kidneys are being affected by the high sugar levels. Your blood pressure also needs better control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is we've caught this early, and we can take action now. We need to adjust your medications to get both your blood sugar and blood pressure down to safer levels. We'll also work together on diet and activity changes that can help. We'll see you more frequently over the coming weeks to make sure we're getting things back on track and preventing any further problems.\n"
