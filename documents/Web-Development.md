## Web Development

Web development is the practice of building and maintaining websites and web applications, usually split into frontend (client‑side) and backend (server‑side) work. Frontend development focuses on what users see and interact with in the browser, built with HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), and JavaScript (behavior). Modern frontends often use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue to manage state and create component‑based user interfaces.

Backend development handles the server‑side logic, data persistence, authentication, and integration with external services. Backends are commonly written in languages such as Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Java, Ruby, Go, or PHP, often within frameworks like Django, Express, Spring, or Rails. The backend exposes APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) that the frontend calls to fetch and update data, with databases (SQL or NoSQL) providing durable storage.

A typical web stack also includes routing, security (TLS, input validation, access control), caching, and deployment to cloud platforms or container orchestrators. Performance, accessibility, and responsive design matter because users access applications from diverse devices and networks. For you as an architect, web development is where UX constraints, business logic, and infrastructure decisions meet, and it sets many of the integration points for other systems.
