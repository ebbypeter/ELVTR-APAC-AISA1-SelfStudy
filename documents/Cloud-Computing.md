## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on‑demand delivery of computing resources—servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and more—over the internet with pay‑as‑you‑go pricing. Instead of owning and operating physical hardware, you consume virtualized resources from providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. This enables elasticity (scale up/down quickly), global distribution, and operational offloading for many layers of the stack. [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/cloud-service-models)

Cloud services are typically grouped into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtual machines, storage, and networking where you manage operating systems and applications while the provider manages the underlying hardware. Platform as a Service (PaaS) abstracts infrastructure and runtime so developers can deploy code without managing servers, while Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers fully managed applications accessible via a browser or API.

Modern architectures often leverage managed databases, serverless compute, container orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines to increase delivery speed and reliability. Cloud also underpins machine learning and deep learning workloads with scalable GPU instances and managed ML platforms. The strategic questions are about vendor lock‑in, security and compliance, cost management, and how aggressively to adopt managed services versus building and operating custom platforms.
