## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, and language understanding. AI spans a broad range of techniques, from rule‑based expert systems and search algorithms to probabilistic models and modern machine learning, including deep learning. In practice, most “AI” systems today are powered by machine learning models trained on large datasets. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

AI applications are pervasive: web search, recommendation systems, targeted advertising, virtual assistants, machine translation, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools for text, images, and code. These systems combine perception (e.g., vision, speech recognition), prediction (e.g., risk scoring), and decision‑making under uncertainty. At the infrastructure level, AI relies heavily on cloud computing and specialized hardware because of its data and compute demands.

Key concerns include robustness, bias, privacy, transparency, and societal impact, especially as AI systems move into decision‑making roles in finance, healthcare, law, and critical infrastructure. For you, the meaningful distinction is: AI is the umbrella; machine learning is the dominant implementation paradigm; deep learning is the leading technique for complex, unstructured data. The strategic edge comes from aligning these capabilities with concrete problems, available data, and responsible deployment practices.
