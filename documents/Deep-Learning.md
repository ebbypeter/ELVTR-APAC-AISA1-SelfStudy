## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multilayer artificial neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data. The “deep” in deep learning refers to networks with many layers (often dozens or more), which successively transform raw inputs into increasingly abstract features. These architectures excel at modeling complex, non‑linear relationships in high‑dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

In a deep neural network, data flows from input to output through layers of artificial neurons with learnable weights and non‑linear activation functions. Training typically uses backpropagation and gradient‑based optimization to adjust weights so the network’s predictions better match target outputs. Different architectures are tailored to data types: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images, recurrent and transformer models for sequences, and autoencoders or generative models for representation learning and synthesis.

Deep learning has driven breakthroughs in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation, and generative media. The trade‑offs are high data requirements, significant computational cost (often GPUs or specialized accelerators), and reduced interpretability compared with simpler models. You use deep learning when the signal is rich and complex enough that manual feature engineering and shallow models hit a ceiling.
