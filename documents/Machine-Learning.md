## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence where systems learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each rule. An ML system ingests data, uses algorithms to detect structure, and produces a model that generalizes to new, unseen inputs. This generalization is what lets you classify emails as spam, forecast demand, or score credit risk. [aws.amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/)

Core learning paradigms are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, you train on labeled examples to perform tasks like regression (predict a number) or classification (predict a category). In unsupervised learning, algorithms such as clustering and dimensionality reduction discover structure in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning trains agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward, widely used in control systems and game‑playing agents.

A typical ML workflow involves data collection, cleaning and feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training and evaluation, and finally deployment and monitoring in production. Popular tools include Python, scikit‑learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. The big leverage is that once you cast a business problem as a prediction or decision under uncertainty, you can often replace brittle rule systems with models that improve over time as they see more data.
